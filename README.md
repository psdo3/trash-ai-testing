# Trash AI

## Object Detection Model (BACKEND ONLY)

The server runs on ImageAI using RetinaNet. For it to work, first follow the **[ImageAI setup instructions](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI)**.
Then, download the RetinaNet object detection model **[here](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/essentials-v5/resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5)**.

Once you download the file, place it in the _models_ folder.

1. Set up ImageAI
2. Git bash in the directory: backend-nodejs
3. Type 'node server.js' in the terminal
4. Go to 'localhost:3000' in your browser

Training Data Storage:
//learning algorithm

We create a Training Data storage to contain all the data we will use to build our IA, working with a Machine Learning algorithm. With the datasets in our machine learning, we can train the ML model.
The Platform Training reads data from the Data Storage located where we have granted access to our AI platform training.


The team is searching for a model that has been trained as a proof of concept (POC). POCs has the intention to prove that new technology/service/idea is viable for the market. The POCs involves a developers examining the clientâ€™s requirements, selecting a few to focus on, and creating a proof of concept to meet those requirements.
Trained model is available for view.
